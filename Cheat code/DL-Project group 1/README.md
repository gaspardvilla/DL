Developped by Guilhem AZZANO, Anthony PIQUET and Pierre ERBACHER

Project 1 : Digit comparison

Learning from a dataset(MNIST) of two images, their classes( digit values) and the result of the comparison(Superior or not).
Training of differents models(Convolutional and multilayer perceptron),  with and w/o weight sharing and/or auxiliary losses.

Using the pytorch framework

Project 2 : Custom, homemade deeplearning framework

Using only tensors, we had to develop our own framework to replace the pytorch framework.
Any multilayer perceptron with MSE Loss and ReLu activation should be working.
